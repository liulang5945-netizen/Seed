"""Historical Native v6: why was the write basis weak and unstable?

ANSWERED, and the fix is shipped.  The defect was a path asymmetry in the
homeostatic set point.  The probe reads from ``reset_dynamics``, which rebuilds
state via ``initial_state`` and so pins every threshold at ``threshold_base``
(0.02).  Consolidation starts each replay from ``clear_dynamics``, which
deliberately *preserves* the adapted set point -- correct in itself, since sleep
must not discard what waking learned.  But replay then let homeostasis keep
integrating over a degenerate input: one symbol driven for sixteen ticks with no
waking traffic to balance it.  A unit the engram drives gains
``rate * (1 - target)`` per tick while a silent one sheds only ``rate * target``,
a 7:1 ratchet on exactly the units carrying the memory, measured at a 0.43 peak
set point -- twenty-one times base.  Since

    activity = tanh(relu(membrane - threshold - inhibition))

that subtracts straight off the drive, and ``local_update`` is linear in |trace|,
so the write all but vanished, ``captured`` became arbitrary on a near-null
trace, and one decoder row churned through 118 rewires without terminating.

``fabric.step`` now takes ``adapt_homeostasis``, and ``consolidate`` passes
False: the set point is read during replay, never written.  The arms here are
kept as regression controls -- ``adapt-homeostasis`` reinstates the defect,
``reset-threshold`` is the alternative fix that was rejected because it discards
the waking set point and lost to freezing on every behavioural column.

Two earlier candidates were measured and killed, and should not be revisited:

  * the episodic feedback term -- zeroing ``replay.cortical_projection`` inside the
    burst moved |basis| by under 12% and left the ratio to probe at 0.040, and the
    measured inhibition is 0.0002-0.0021, far too small to suppress anything;
  * a *progressive* within-bout ratchet -- |basis| quartiles for '0'->'+' ran
    0.0075 / 0.0033 / 0.0040 / 0.0055, which is not monotone, and Q1 was already
    1/15 of the probe.  The basis was not ground down over the bout; it was born
    weak, because the inflated set point is inherited across replays through
    ``clear_dynamics`` rather than accumulated within one.
