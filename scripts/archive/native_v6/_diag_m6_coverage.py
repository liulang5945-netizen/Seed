"""Historical Native v6: did replay coverage explain which pair failed?

The plan's next step assumes ``priority`` lets a few engrams monopolise
rehearsal, and that the starved pair is the one the probe cannot read back.  An
earlier version of this script measured a mild 35/19/15/11 split and appeared to
contradict that -- but it was not measuring the same thing the benchmark runs:
it drove ``memory.replay`` in a hand-rolled loop with a freshly seeded
generator, pretrained for 3 epochs instead of 6, and hardcoded seed 29 with 96
ticks while the failure was characterised on seed 11 at 384.

This version instruments the real ``consolidate`` -- same RNG stream, same
pretraining, same arm the verifier scores -- and joins the rehearsal counts
against the per-pair margins from the same run, so coverage and outcome are
measured on one model instead of two.
