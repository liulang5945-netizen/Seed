"""Historical Native v6: which set-point candidate moved behaviour?

The probe softmaxes only over the four outcome bytes, so chance is 0.25 and the
entropy trap of the full 257-way readout does not apply here.  Yet measured
true probabilities sit at 0.2509 with margins near 1e-3, which means the four
raw logits are nearly identical.  This measures the raw evidence directly: the
absolute scale, the pre-existing row bias sleep has to overcome, and how much
one consolidation bout actually moves it.

It now runs that measurement once per arm of ``_diag_m6_write_basis``.  Both
candidate fixes for the ``clear_dynamics`` set-point asymmetry restore the write
basis and collapse rewiring from 311 to 16, so basis fidelity cannot choose
between them: ``reset-threshold`` lands exactly on probe scale but discards the
waking-learned set point, while ``freeze-homeostasis`` preserves it and
overshoots (ratio 1.13-1.43), risking a write/read scale mismatch.  Only the
evidence the probe actually reads can arbitrate.
