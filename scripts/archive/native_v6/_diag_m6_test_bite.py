"""Historical Native v6: confirm tests failed when the defect was reinstated.

A regression test that passes under both the fix and the bug is worse than no
test at all, because it converts a silent failure into a false assurance.  The
``adapt-homeostasis`` arm in ``_diag_m6_write_basis`` reinstates the pre-fix
behaviour, so running the same assertions inside it is a direct check that each
test is load-bearing.
