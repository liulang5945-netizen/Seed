"""Historical Native v6: why did a rehearsed pair still lose its margin?

Coverage is no longer the constraint -- every pair now gets 8-33% of the
rehearsals -- yet three pairs still read back wrong with margins within 0.002 of
zero.  Section 6.5 asks for a quantitative attribution before any mechanism
change: is the true cell simply underdosed, or is the same burst that teaches it
also lifting its competitor?

The write is linear in the basis it lands on, so the attribution can be read off
directly.  Four bases are frozen up front by probing the pre-sleep checkpoint
exactly the way ``_evaluate_contingency`` probes the post-sleep one.  Then, at
every replay entry, ``decoders[0]`` is evaluated on all four frozen bases, which
costs four sparse matvecs.  Differencing consecutive snapshots attributes the
whole change to the one accepted replay that happened in between, so each burst
can be charged for what it did to every basis, not just its own.

    Section 6.6 fixed this as the precondition before touching ``fabric.step``.

    positive rescaling cannot change a sign: the renormalisation the real

    The scan has a distinguished point.  Writing the basis as
    ``b_p = a_p u + d_p`` with ``u`` the four-action mean, subtracting the mean
    at gain exactly 1 leaves ``d_p`` alone -- the only part of the basis that
    carries probe identity.  Gain 1 is thus the honest ceiling of any
