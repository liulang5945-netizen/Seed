# Taiji Substrate Kernel v8 Code Wiki

This page maps the current executable TSK-v8 kernel to source code. It is not the complete Taiji cognitive architecture. The product/runtime wrapper is in [`seed/`](seed), the Taiji v1 target is in [TAIJI_NATIVE_ARCHITECTURE_V1.md](plans/active/TAIJI_NATIVE_ARCHITECTURE_V1.md), the kernel equations are preserved in [TAIJI_SUBSTRATE_KERNEL_V8_SPEC.md](plans/archive/implementation/TAIJI_SUBSTRATE_KERNEL_V8_SPEC.md), and the frozen Legacy NeuroPlex baseline is documented in [INTERFACE_REFERENCE.md](INTERFACE_REFERENCE.md).

## Runtime path

```text
Taiji.observe(symbol)
  ├─ if an action was settled: bind cue/action/reward/current outcome in EpisodicField
  ├─ settle previous ByteMotor prediction with the real symbol
  ├─ ByteSensor.encode(symbol)
  ├─ TaijiFabric.step(sensor_activity, previous_regions, prior_memory_feedback)
  │    ├─ fast sparse prediction + slow signed consolidation prediction
  │    ├─ reciprocal error backprojection
  │    ├─ recurrent next-state prediction
  │    ├─ delayed top-down prediction
  │    ├─ membrane / inhibition / threshold / trace update
  │    └─ waking fast-path updates or sleep-gated slow-path updates
  ├─ concatenate every region's fast activity and slow trace
  ├─ EpisodicField.recall(cortical_state)
  │    ├─ distributed cue code + recurrent pattern completion
  │    ├─ resonance-gated action/outcome/value/time/source readouts
  │    └─ install cortical feedback for the next causal tick
  ├─ SparseReceptorBank folds every cortical coordinate into K shared channels
  ├─ ByteMotor.probabilities(context + episodic action evidence)
  └─ atomically install the next TaijiState
```

Active interaction adds:

```text
Taiji.act(affordances)
  → store pending context / restricted policy / executed action
environment.step(action)
  → reward + next sensation
Taiji.settle_action(reward)
  → reward-baseline-modulated local motor update
  → install PendingExperience(cue, action, reward, tick, episode, provenance)
Taiji.observe(outcome, learn_motor=False)
  → consume PendingExperience and write one distributed engram
```

## Modules

### `taiji/config.py`

`TaijiConfig` is the complete **kernel** contract: alphabet, region and field sizes, fan-in, dynamics, kernel homeostasis, cortical/episodic learning rates, norm limits, memory completion/readback gains, motor temperature, and seed. It is serialized inside every TSK-v8 checkpoint; Taiji v1 adds higher-level cognitive state contracts rather than treating this config as the whole architecture.

### `taiji/sparse.py`

`SparseSynapses` owns a compressed fixed-fan-in topology. `pre_index[post, edge]` and `edge_weight[post, edge]` are the only synapse arrays; the postsynaptic row is implicit. Key methods:

- `forward(pre)` — postsynaptic evidence;
- `backproject(error)` — reciprocal bottom-up error;
- `local_update(error, trace)` — existing-edge-only error × eligibility update;
- `to_payload/load_payload` — exact topology and weight persistence.

Weights are regular tensors with `requires_grad=False`. There is no mask or absent-edge weight to allocate. Forward uses gather-sum, reciprocal projection uses scatter-add, and learning never constructs a dense outer product.

### `taiji/state.py`

`RegionState` contains membrane, activity, trace, prediction, error, adaptive threshold, and inhibitory-pool state. `MemoryState` contains field activity/trace, threshold, inhibition, confidence and one-tick-delayed cortical feedback. `TaijiState` owns every region plus memory, motor context/probabilities, causal time, optional `PendingAction`, and optional `PendingExperience`. `MemoryRecall`, `TaijiStep`, `TaijiDecision` and `TaijiOutcome` are immutable public results.

### `taiji/organs.py`

`ByteSensor` maps bytes 0–255 and boundary 256 to fixed one-hot receptor activity. `SparseReceptorBank` gives every cortical activity/trace coordinate exactly one fixed signed edge. `ByteMotor` supports both next-symbol local settlement and three-factor reward learning with a running reward baseline.

### `taiji/environment.py`

`TaijiEnvironment` defines `reset()` and action-dependent `step()`. `EnvironmentOutcome` carries only sensation, scalar reward and terminal state—never a teacher action.

### `taiji/memory.py`

`EpisodicField` is the native field-memory algorithm. Fixed sparse encoders project cortical state, action, outcome, reward, sinusoidal tick, hashed episode signature and four-valued provenance into overlapping field units. A blank fixed-fan-in recurrent graph learns cue→event completion and autoassociation with the same `SparseSynapses.local_update()` operator used elsewhere. Novelty and absolute reward gate each write.

Readout uses a shared compressed field context. It reconstructs value-modulated action evidence, outcome distribution, reward, cortical state, time code, episode code and provenance. Learned familiarity and recurrent resonance jointly gate every effect; zeroing recurrent weights therefore leaves the same field width and readouts but removes behavior. No event object, key, value or slot is appended when `write_count` increases.

### `taiji/fabric.py`

`TaijiFabric` constructs a fast sparse decoder, a recurrent transition graph and a zero-initialized slow consolidation decoder per region. The slow row has complete shared support and reads `trace - trace_baseline`; its baseline updates only under varied waking learning and freezes during evaluation/replay. Sleep trains it with an endogenous winner-neuron resource, while the fast path and transitions keep their own rates. Each added bank uses a dedicated RNG stream so organ composition cannot shift existing topology. `step()` remains the canonical causal ordering and adds prior field feedback with a one-tick delay.

### `taiji/model.py`

`Taiji` owns organs, fabric, state, RNG and persistence:

- `observe(symbol, learn=True, use_memory=True)` — one causal tick and optional causal memory lesion;
- `act(affordances)` / `settle_action(reward)` — active action transaction;
- `learn_bytes(data, epochs)` — online local development;
- `score_bytes(data)` — no-side-effect teacher-forced evaluation;
- `generate(prompt, length)` — action feedback loop;
- `checkpoint()/restore()` — topology + parameters + all fast/transaction state + RNG.

## Checkpoint format

Current substrate checkpoints use `format = taiji-native-v7`, state version 5, and contain:

```text
config
fabric.decoders[].pre_index + edge_weight
fabric.consolidation_decoders[].pre_index + edge_weight
fabric.trace_baselines[]
fabric.transitions[].pre_index + edge_weight
motor.receptors.channel + motor.receptors.polarity
motor.synapses + motor.bias + reward baseline/update count
memory fixed encoders + recurrent/readout synapses + write count
state.regions + state.memory + pending action/experience
rng_state
```

They never contain a NeuroPlex neuron, tokenizer, Transformer block, LM head, LoRA adapter, or teacher reference.

## Legacy code

Everything under `neuroplex/` is the frozen Transformer population baseline. Its old interface notes remain in [INTERFACE_REFERENCE.md](INTERFACE_REFERENCE.md), which is not a Taiji API reference.
