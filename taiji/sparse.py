        """Regrow weightless edges onto active partners; return contacts moved.

        A fixed fan-in drawn once at initialization is a lottery. Region codes
        are only nominally dense -- a settled trace lights 21-34 of 64 units
        but concentrates 60-98% of its energy in two or three of them -- so
        whether a row's 16 sampled contacts happen to touch the informative
        units decides, by geometry alone, whether that row can be taught at
        all. Measured across four contingencies the energy a row captured
        spanned three orders of magnitude, and the worst row needed millions
        of updates to move. That is not a dose problem, and no rescaling of
        the code fixes it: divisive normalization leaves the captured fraction
        bit-identical, because it changes the scale and not the shape.

        So the topology itself has to move. A row retires its presynaptically
        silent contacts, weakest first, and grows that many replacements onto
        the most active units it is not already touching. Silence is the whole
        admission test: a partner that is not firing on the pattern being
        written contributes exactly zero to this update, whatever its weight
        says. Weight enters only as the order of retirement, which is the right
        place for it -- a silent edge may still be carrying some *other*
        pattern, and going weakest-first spends the row's least committed
        contacts before its most committed ones. It cannot be an admission test
        as well, because a silent edge is often a strong one: measured on the
        four outcome rows, 5 to 11 of 16 contacts were silent, yet demanding
        they also fall under 5% of the row maximum admitted only 3, 1, 0 and 0
        of them, which stalled two rows outright.

        ``turnover_ratio`` caps how much of a row may move in any single update.
        Rewiring the 4 weakest of 16 contacts raised captured energy from 0.029
        to 0.971 on one row and from 0.0001 to 0.781 on the worst; pushing to 8
        sent a fourth row *backwards*, 0.962 down to 0.625, because by then
        retirement had reached contacts that were doing real work under other
        patterns. The ceiling is therefore a measured turnover rate rather than
        a safety margin -- but it is a rate, and a rate alone cannot terminate
        anything, which is what ``capture_target`` is for.

        The remaining gate is that the row must currently be mispredicting, and
        it is the gate that supplies selectivity. Rewiring on its own only
        supplies capacity -- pointing every row at the same active units raises
        what all of them capture, which discriminates nothing. But at a
        consolidation write the error is nearly one-hot: the row for the outcome
        actually being replayed carries an error near one while the rest of the
        alphabet sits two orders of magnitude below it. Thresholding on error
        therefore restructures exactly the row that needs the capacity and
        leaves the others alone, which is why error is used as a gate and never
        as a way to rank candidates -- within a row it is a single scalar and
        could not rank anything.

        Requiring the retired partner to be silent keeps a single held pattern
        from thrashing. A new contact opens at zero weight, so it is instantly
        among the weakest edges in its row, and a purely magnitude-based
        criterion would retire it again on the very next tick and never let it
        accumulate anything. A fresh donor is by construction one of the most
        active absent units, so silence excludes it from the retirement pool for
        exactly as long as it stays active. That protection lasts only while the
        pattern is held, though, which is why it does not by itself make the rule
        stable across a whole bout and why ``capture_target`` is the gate that
        does.

        Opening at zero weight also means the swap is behaviourally neutral at
        the instant it happens -- every edge it replaces contributed nothing to
        this pattern, being silent on it -- and the ordinary error x eligibility
        update grows it from there. Row fan-in never changes, so every stored
        shape is invariant and the payload format is untouched.
