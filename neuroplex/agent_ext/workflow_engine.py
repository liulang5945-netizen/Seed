"""Workflow engine stub — not yet implemented.

This is a minimal stub that allows imports to succeed. It is imported
at module top-level by ``api.routes_workflows``, so all classes here
must be importable and instantiable without side effects.

The real implementation will execute multi-step workflows against the
agent runtime and persist them via WorkflowStore.
