    Consolidation drives one symbol for sixteen ticks with no waking traffic to

    tick while a silent one sheds only ``rate * target``.  That 7:1 ratchet acts
    on exactly the units carrying the memory: measured, it drove the set point to
    twenty-one times ``threshold_base`` and, because ``activity`` subtracts the
    threshold straight off the drive, collapsed the write basis to 1/22 of the
    basis the probe reproduces.  The bout then wrote almost nothing while
    churning one decoder row through 118 rewires.

    The set point is therefore read during replay and never written.  This test
    pins that directly rather than pinning a downstream accuracy number, because
    the defect it guards against is silent: the bout still runs, still accepts
    engrams, and still reports plausible statistics while learning nothing.
