# Seed — powered by the Taiji Native Predictive Substrate

**Seed** is the project and model. **Taiji** is Seed's native computational substrate, built to replace the Transformer bottom layer outright: it defines its own input representation, persistent state transition, distributed episodic field, local learning rules, motor output, active-environment loop, free-running generation, and checkpoint format.

## Naming

| Name | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Seed** | the project and model-level organism; distribution/package `seed` |
| **Taiji** / Taiji Predictive Fabric (TPF) | Seed's computational substrate replacing the Transformer; package `taiji/`, current checkpoint line Native v7 |
| **Legacy NeuroPlex** | the frozen Transformer baseline in `neuroplex/`; the replaced bottom layer is `neuroplex/layers.py::TransformerBlock` |
| `taiji.*` in `scripts/archive/` | a historical import alias for `neuroplex`, not this substrate |

## What Taiji replaces

Taiji does not wrap a Transformer in neuron terminology. The native path is:

```text
raw byte receptors
  → hierarchical reciprocal prediction errors
  → persistent recurrent region states
  ↔ distributed episodic field and cortical readback
  → balanced sparse cortical receptor bank
  → one byte motor organ
  → emitted action returns as the next sensation
```

| Transformer responsibility | Taiji Native v7 |
|---|---|
| tokenizer + learned embedding | 256 raw-byte receptors + boundary receptor |
| positional encoding | causal ticks and persistent state |
| self-attention | sparse reciprocal prediction and recurrent transitions |
| residual/FFN state | membrane integration, inhibition, adaptive thresholds, traces |
| KV cache / external retrieval | bounded dynamic state plus distributed associative engrams; no event K/V slots |
| global backpropagation | existing-edge local prediction/state/motor/memory deltas |
| LM head | all-state sparse receptor bank + one motor population |
| autoregressive decode | motor byte fed back through the same sensor |

The implementation imports neither `transformers` nor the legacy `neuroplex` runtime. PyTorch is used only as a tensor execution engine.

## Algorithm

For region `r`, the previous local trace predicts both the current lower-level activity and the region's own next activity:

```math
\hat y_t^{r-1}=D^r q_{t-1}^r, \qquad e_t^{r-1}=y_t^{r-1}-\hat y_t^{r-1}
```

```math
\hat a_t^r=T^r q_{t-1}^r
```

The region integrates bottom-up error, recurrent prediction, and delayed top-down context:

```math
u_t^r=Bound(\lambda_u u_{t-1}^r+\alpha_g(D^r)^Te_t^{r-1}+\alpha_T\hat a_t^r+\alpha_c c_t^r)
```

Activity is formed through an adaptive threshold and a local inhibitory pool. Learning is online and local:

```math
\Delta D^r=\eta_D e_t^{r-1}(q_{t-1}^r)^T
```

```math
\Delta T^r=\eta_T(a_t^r-T^rq_{t-1}^r)(q_{t-1}^r)^T
```

```math
\Delta M=\eta_M(onehot(b_t)-p_{t-1})c_{t-1}^T
```

The motor does not discard a random cortical subset. It concatenates every region's fast activity and slow trace into `s_t`, then a fixed balanced single-fan-out receptor map `H` folds every coordinate into `K` shared evidence channels:

```math
\tilde c_{t,k}=|G_k|^{-1/2}\sum_{j\in G_k}\sigma_j s_{t,j},
\qquad
c_t=\gamma_c\frac{\tilde c_t}{\lVert\tilde c_t\rVert_2+\epsilon}
```

Every cortical coordinate reaches exactly one receptor, and every action competes on the same `K` channels.

An active transition is stored only after the full causal tuple is available. A cortical cue `s`, executed action `a`, reward `r`, resulting sensation `o`, causal tick, episode signature and provenance excite one overlapping engram population `h`. Existing recurrent edges learn cue-to-event completion:

```math
h^{event}=\phi(Qs+\gamma_e(Aa+Oo+r\rho+Tt+Ee+Pp)),
\qquad
\Delta W^{mem}=\eta_m g(h^{event}-W^{mem}h^{cue})(h^{cue})^T
```

`g` is a novelty/reward write gate. Recurrent resonance gates all recalled action, outcome, value, time, episode and provenance evidence; recalled cortical state is injected into the next fabric tick. Events share the same fixed population and edge topology—writing an event does not append a row, key or value.

Every update is restricted to stored fixed-fan-in edges. There is no dense structural mask, attention matrix, context window, optimizer, `backward()`, teacher model, or distillation path.

The complete tensor shapes, update order, state contract, complexity, and code mapping are in [the architecture specification](plans/active/TAIJI_SUBSTRATE_ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Quick start

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
python scripts/training/verify_taiji_native_v7.py
python scripts/training/verify_taiji_n7_context.py
python scripts/training/verify_taiji_n8_delayed_trace.py
python scripts/training/verify_taiji_n9_long_free_run.py
python scripts/training/verify_taiji_n10_sparse_migration.py
python scripts/training/verify_taiji_n11_active_environment.py
python scripts/training/verify_taiji_m5_episodic_field.py
python -m pytest tests/taiji_native -q
```

Seed model API:

```python
from seed import Seed

model = Seed()
model.learn_bytes(b"abcdabcdabcdabcd", epochs=200)

print(model.score_bytes(b"abcdabcdabcdabcd"))
print(model.generate(b"a", length=8))

checkpoint = model.checkpoint()
restored = Seed.from_checkpoint(checkpoint)
```

Researchers may still import `Taiji` directly for substrate-only falsification experiments. Production-facing composition belongs in `seed/`.

## Public Beta

Seed ships as a self-contained Windows desktop build (dual-entry `Seed.exe` + `SeedBackend.exe`,
about 1.1GB): double-click launches the backend, activates the Seed native runtime, and serves the
web UI on `http://127.0.0.1:8000` within a few seconds. Development mode equivalent:

```bash
python -m uvicorn api.app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000   # backend + web UI (serves frontend/dist)
python desktop/main.py                                         # desktop shell (window + backend + WebSocket 8765)
cd frontend && npm run dev                                     # frontend dev server
```

Environment knobs: `SEED_PORT` (default 8000), `SEED_HOST` (default 127.0.0.1),
`SEED_RUNTIME=1` (activate the Seed native runtime on startup).

Beta verification evidence lives in `reports/` (API stress 1000/1000, checkpoint crash-recovery
10/10, latency/throughput baselines, frontend review) and the release report
`reports/seed_public_beta_release_20260823.md`. End-user instructions (install, chat, training,
known limits) are in [docs/seed_public_beta_user_guide.md](docs/seed_public_beta_user_guide.md).
Current checkpoints are early-stage: garbled replies are expected model behavior, not defects.

## Reproducible Taiji substrate results

The committed verification uses two regions `[64, 48]`, seed `7`, and raw bytes:

| Metric | Result |
|---|---:|
| active learned parameters | 83,841 |
| fixed motor receptor edges | 224 (one per cortical coordinate) |
| actual learned scalar storage | 83,841 |
| dense-equivalent learned scalars | 138,161 |
| learned compressed topology | 81,792 int32 pre-indices |
| byte-cycle accuracy | 0% → 94.12% |
| mean surprise | 5.4041 → 0.1069 |
| surprise reduction | 98.02% |
| free generation | `a → bcdabcda` (all eight steps correct) |
| checkpoint exact-next-step | pass |

On the N7 ambiguous stream, full Taiji predicts all eight history-dependent `x → b/d` successors correctly. A first-order model and a full dynamic-state lesion both score 50%. N7's trace-only lesion remains at 100%, showing that its immediate history can live in fast state.

N8 inserts the shared distractors `1234` between cue and probe. Full and trace-only states score 100%; removing trace or all dynamic state scores 50%. This establishes that slow trace is necessary and sufficient for this fixed-delay behavior, but it is not yet evidence of episodic or autobiographical memory.

N9 trains the same 16-byte cycle under an explicit non-terminal stream contract, then feeds back 128 motor actions with no teacher forcing. All 128 positions are exact, all four actions remain present, and membrane/trace/threshold bounds hold at every tick. A terminal boundary is deliberately excluded from this benchmark because teaching “stop after the fourth cycle” would contradict an infinite-cycle target.

N10 replaces masked-dense synapses with compressed fixed-fan-in rows. Against a dense reference, forward differs by at most `2.98e-8`; backprojection and local update are exact. N5–N9 behavior regressions all still pass. Including the new field, the small v5 benchmark uses 111.22% of dense learned-weight bytes after int32 indices, while the default projects to 98.59%. This validates real edge execution, not a universal speedup claim; sparse indexing only wins storage at lower edge density.

N11 separates external sensation from action credit. On a two-cue environment where action changes both reward and the next `+/-` sensation, the last 40 online interactions reach 100% success versus 50% random and 57.5% with action learning disabled. Taiji receives only scalar reward and outcome sensation—never the correct action label. A pending action and its eligibility are atomically checkpointed until outcome settlement.

M5 stores eight one-shot active episodes in one shared 128-unit field. Writing uses a singleton demonstrated affordance with fabric/motor learning disabled; querying opens two actions, so this isolates associative recall rather than action discovery. Cross-episode action recall is 87.5%, versus 25% for equal-width trace-only execution and 25% after recurrent-association lesion. Outcome and provenance recall are 100%, episode identity is 75%, mean time-code cosine is 0.519, and recalled cortical state measurably changes the next fabric tick. The field allocates zero per-event slots.

Current reports: [Native v7](reports/taiji_native_v7_20260822.json), [M6 v7 seed panel](reports/taiji_m6_seed_panel_v7_20260822.json), [N10 v7 regression](reports/taiji_n10_v7_20260822.json), [N11 v7](reports/taiji_n11_v7_20260822.json), and [M5 v7](reports/taiji_m5_v7_20260822.json). Earlier Native v2–v6 reports remain migration evidence.

A single seed cannot separate a mechanism change from seed-specific idiosyncrasy, so mechanism-level decisions read the M6 seed panel (`verify_taiji_m6_endogenous_replay.py --panel`, 12 seeds) rather than one run, and a baseline is always re-executed from a clean worktree instead of read out of a committed report.

## Legacy NeuroPlex

`neuroplex/` contains the previous nine-member Transformer population, including all five dialogue members. It is retained only for reproducibility and future same-budget comparisons. It is not imported by Taiji.

Historical checkpoints that serialized `taiji.*` names are loaded through the scoped `neuroplex.legacy_checkpoint` compatibility utility; importing NeuroPlex no longer shadows the native `taiji` package.

Install legacy application dependencies only when reproducing that baseline:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[legacy]"
```

## Current falsification target

Native v7 now implements a slow signed shared-support consolidation pathway beside the fast sparse predictor. A waking-only baseline defines signed eligibility; each endogenous replay winner owns a bout-local resource retained at `0.9`; a dedicated RNG stream prevents the new pathway from shifting existing organs. The strict M6 panel reaches 4/4 on all 12 seeds, while every no-replay control stays at chance (25%). M7 now provides the next biting baseline: action→outcome remains 100%, but cue→action cortical evidence is exactly zero and behavior does not beat no replay. The current implementation target is an endogenous cue-reinstatement phase before the existing action→outcome burst.
