"""Native sleep scheduling: the judge drives consolidation.

Phase 3 wiring ("the eye drives the hand"): the self-evaluation organ picks
*what* to sleep on -- patterns the organism handles worst, ranked by judge
quality -- and the substrate's own endogenous replay decides *how* to
consolidate.  No Python replay list exists: the scheduler only creates real
experiences (``act`` + ``settle_action`` + next ``observe`` writes one
episodic engram each) and then hands the field to ``consolidate``, whose
internal priority gate accepts or rejects each spontaneous reactivation.

Pure observational training never writes episodes (there is no act/settle),
which is exactly why waking corpus runs replay nothing.  Selection reads the
judge quality (the eye picks what to sleep on), and the reward bound into
each engram is that same judge quality for the whole text: the valence axis
must carry the self assessment so low valued patterns get replayed first.
The write path bounds the injected reward to a unit interval itself
(unit-slope clip) and gates readout plasticity by identity, value and redundancy,
so one episode can no longer flood the shared readout rows (800K collapse,
phase 3).
