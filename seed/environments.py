"""Native play environment: a text topic world for autonomous exploration.

Phase 3 play organ.  The world implements the ``TaijiEnvironment`` protocol:
every transition genuinely depends on the organism's action -- at a choice
moment the afforded actions are the distinct opening bytes of the topic pool
(minus any topic locked out by the anti-lock-in scaffold), and the organism's
own motor policy decides which direction to explore.  Once a topic is chosen
the world streams its bytes as sensations while the organism acts to complete
each position; completion rewards reward-modulated motor learning, but the
sensory stream never waits for a "correct" answer -- the environment is an
outcome provider, not a teacher.

Anti-lock-in scaffold (B1-bis semantics): when the organism picks the same
topic ``force_switch_streak`` episodes in a row, that topic is withdrawn from
the affordances for the next episode, so exploration cannot ossify on one
direction.  The scaffold shapes what is afforded, never what is chosen.

The ``play`` driver runs the canonical active sequence from the architecture
document: ``observe(cue) -> act(affordances) -> env.step(action) ->
settle_action(reward) -> observe(outcome.sensation)``, closing every pending
experience with a final boundary observation so the episodic field receives
real ``experienced`` engrams ready for endogenous replay.
