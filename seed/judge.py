"""Seed's native self-evaluation organ.

The judge is the organism's "eye": it reads the self-referential signals the
substrate already produces while it consumes text -- per-tick surprise,
regional prediction-error accumulation and episodic recall confidence -- and
folds them into a single sortable quality score.  Higher quality means the
organism predicts the text better.

The combination weights are local parameters of the organ.  ``calibrate``
fits them with a closed-form ridge solve from known good/bad pairs; no
external reward model, teacher signal or legacy judge head participates.

Scoring is strictly read-only: the organ snapshots the substrate, runs a
no-learning pass over the text, and restores the snapshot before returning.
